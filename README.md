# packageDeliverySimulation
This repo is for package delivering simulation that allows user entarence to simulate simultaneously.

User can create delivery point to deliver different kind of package to the destination that user created and connected them each other. 

Users should consider connection networkts between delivery point and destination. Becase every delivery point differs from others by sending different package type. 

These package type delivery points send is provided by central point. 

Central point is the main center that create different kind of delivery package randomly. 

There are 4 type of package and their destination buildings in simulation. Additionally, there are plenty of delivery point and only one central point.
